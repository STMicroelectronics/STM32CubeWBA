## <b>PWR_STANDBY_RTC Example Description</b>

How to enter the Standby mode and wake-up from this mode by using an external 
reset or the RTC wakeup timer.


In the associated software, the system clock is set to 100 MHz and the SysTick is
programmed to generate an interrupt each 1 ms.
The Low Speed Internal (LSI) clock is used as RTC clock source by default.
 is internally connected to the RTC Wakeup event.

The system automatically enters Standby mode 5 sec. after start-up. The RTC wake-up
is configured to generate an interrupt on rising edge about 33 sec. afterwards.
Current consumption in Standby mode with RTC feature enabled can be measured during that time.
More than half a minute is chosen to ensure current convergence to its lowest operating point.

After wake-up from Standby mode, program execution restarts in the same way as after
a software RESET.

Two leds LD1 and LD3 are used to monitor the system state as following:

 - LD3 ON: configuration failed (system will go to an infinite loop)
 - LD1 toggling: system in Run mode
 - LD1 off : system in Standby mode

These steps are repeated in an infinite loop.


Note: This example can not be used in DEBUG mode due to the fact 
      that the Cortex-M33 core is no longer clocked during low power mode 
      so debugging features are disabled.

#### <b>Notes</b>

 1. Care must be taken when HAL_RCCEx_PeriphCLKConfig() is used to select 
    the RTC clock source; in this case the Backup domain will be reset in  
    order to modify the RTC Clock source, as consequence RTC registers (including 
    the backup registers) and RCC_CSR register are set to their reset values.

 2. Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
    based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
    a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
    than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
    To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
 3. The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
    to have correct HAL operation.
