<p>How to update Over The Air (OTA) FW application and Copro Wireless
binary using Thread (Server side).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>This example runs on STM32WBA65xx devices.</p></li>
<li><p>This example has been tested with an STMicroelectronics STM32WBA65RIV6_Nucleo board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-use-it"><strong>How to use it?</strong></h3>
<p>In order to make the program work, you must do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect 2 STM32WBA65xx_Nucleo boards to your PC</li>
<li>Open your preferred toolchain</li>
<li>Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory</li>
<li>Run the application</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> when LED1, LED2 and LED3 are toggling it is
indicating an error has occurred on application.</p>
<p>If you want to control this application, you can directly send and
retrieve Cli commands connecting an HyperTerminal with the FTDI cable as
following :</p>
<ul>
<li>TX GPIO 17<br />
</li>
<li>RX GPIO 18</li>
</ul>
<p>In a Thread network, nodes are split into two forwarding roles:
<strong>Router</strong> or <strong>End Device</strong>.<br />
The Thread <strong>Leader</strong> is a Router that is responsible for
managing the set of Routers in a Thread network.<br />
An End Device (or child) communicates primarily with a <strong>single
Router</strong>.</p>
<p>In our Application which uses two devices, one device will act as a
Leader (Router) and the other one will act as an End Device(mode
child).</p>
<p>After the reset of the 2 boards, one board will be in Leader mode
(<strong>Green LED2 ON</strong>).<br />
The other one will be in Child mode (<strong>Red LED3 ON</strong>).</p>
<p>This Thread application provides implementation example for Updating
FW on Application side and on Copro Wireless side. Thread_OTA_Client can
only communicate with Thread_OTA_Server.</p>
<p>Following diagram describes the Update procedure:</p>
