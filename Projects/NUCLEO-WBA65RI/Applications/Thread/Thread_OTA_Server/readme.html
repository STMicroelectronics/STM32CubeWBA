Application Description</strong></h2>
<p>How to update Over The Air (OTA) FW application and Copro Wireless
binary using Thread (Server side).</p>
<h3 id="keywords"><strong>Keywords</strong></h3>
<p>Connectivity, 802.15.4 protocol, Thread, OTA, COAP</p>
<h3 id="hardware-and-software-environment"><strong>Hardware and Software
environment</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>This example runs on STM32WBA65xx devices.</p></li>
<li><p>This example has been tested with an STMicroelectronics
STM32WBA65CGA_Nucleo board and can be easily tailored to any other
supported device and development board.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-use-it"><strong>How to use it?</strong></h3>
<p>In order to make the program work, you must do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect 2 STM32WBA65xx_Nucleo boards to your PC</li>
<li>Open your preferred toolchain</li>
<li>Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory</li>
<li>Run the application</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> when LED1, LED2 and LED3 are toggling it is
indicating an error has occurred on application.</p>
<p>If you want to control this application, you can directly send and
retrieve Cli commands connecting an HyperTerminal with the FTDI cable as
following :</p>
<ul>
<li>TX GPIO 17<br />
</li>
<li>RX GPIO 18</li>
</ul>
<p>In a Thread network, nodes are split into two forwarding roles:
<strong>Router</strong> or <strong>End Device</strong>.<br />
The Thread <strong>Leader</strong> is a Router that is responsible for
managing the set of Routers in a Thread network.<br />
An End Device (or child) communicates primarily with a <strong>single
Router</strong>.</p>
<p>In our Application which uses two devices, one device will act as a
Leader (Router) and the other one will act as an End Device(mode
child).</p>
<p>After the reset of the 2 boards, one board will be in Leader mode
(<strong>Green LED2 ON</strong>).<br />
The other one will be in Child mode (<strong>Red LED3 ON</strong>).</p>
<p>This Thread application provides implementation example for Updating
FW on Application side and on Copro Wireless side. Thread_OTA_Server can
communicate Thread_OTA_Client for the FUOTA procedure and any
application compatible with Ota settings (see Thread_Coap_Generic_Ota
for details) for requesting the application to reset and give the
control to Thread_OTA_Client .</p>
<p>IMPORTANT PREREQUISITES: On Thread_OTA_Server a binary image has to
be loaded at <span class="citation" data-cites="0x08100000">@0x08100000</span> before starting the process.
It can be FW application example (compatible with Ota settings, see
Thread_Coap_Generic_Ota for details).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>press the SW1 Push-Button on Thread_OTA_Server to send a
<strong>COAP command (Confirmable) “FUOTA_PROVISIONING” </strong> from
Thread_OTA_Server to Thread_OTA_CLient .<br />
if Thread_OTA_CLient confirm the message the Thread_OTA_Server will
start the FUOTA procedure.</p></li>
<li><p>press the SW3 Push-Button on boad Thread_OTA_Server to send a
<strong>COAP command (Confirmable) “FUOTA_REBOOT”</strong> from
Thread_OTA_Server to Thread_Coap_Generic_Ota .<br />
The board Thread_Coap_Generic_Ota will receive COAP commands and send to
board A a <strong>Coap Data response</strong> then reset and give the
control to Thread_OTA_Client.</p></li>
</ul>
