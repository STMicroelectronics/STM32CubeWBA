## __BLE_p2pServer_Ext Application Description__

Demonstrates STM32WBA using BLE basic plus stack version to utilize several extended advertising sets.  

The BLE p2pServer_Ext application advertises several extended advertising sets:  

- A legacy advertising.  
- A connectable extended advertising.  
- A scannable extended advertising.  
- A not connectable and not scannable extended advertising.  

These sets are configurable in file adv_ext_app.c.  

For a legacy advertising set please refer to the <a href="https://wiki.st.com/stm32mcu/wiki/Connectivity:STM32WBA_Peer_To_Peer#STM32WBA_Peer_to_Peer_Server_application"> STM32WBA Peer To Peer Server Applications.</a>  

### __Keywords__

Connectivity, BLE, extended, advertising.  

### __Hardware and Software environment__

  - This application runs on STM32WBA65xx devices.  
  - Connect the Nucleo Board to your PC with a USB cable type A to type C to ST-LINK connector (USB_STLINK).  
  - Another STM32WBAxx Nucleo board  may be necessary to run p2pClient_Ext application.  

### __How to use it?__

In order to make the program work:  

 - Open your preferred toolchain.  
 - Rebuild all files and flash the STM32WBAxx Nucleo board at the address 0x08000000 with the executable file.  
 - Run the example.  
 
 __You can interact with p2pServer_Ext application with a smartphone:__  

Use one of the following remote interfaces to interact with your device: <a href="https://wiki.st.com/stm32mcu/wiki/Connectivity:BLE_smartphone_applications#Bluetooth-C2-AE_LE_collector_applications_for_STM32WBA
"> Bluetooth LE collector applications for STM32WBA.</a>  

 - Enable extended advertising in scan panel.  
 - You can see data advertised by BLE p2pServer_Ext application.  
 - Moreover, you can connect to the legacy adverting set; your device acts like in the BLE p2pServer application.  

 __You can interact with BLE p2pServer_Ext application with another Nucleo board running BLE p2pClient_Ext:__  

 - Power up BLE p2pClient_Ext devices next to BLE p2pServer_Ext device.  
 - On the BLE p2pClient_Ext device, click button B1 to start scanning.  
   - The BLE p2pServer_Ext connectable extended advertising in discovered, and the BD address is registered.  
   - Then, on the BLE p2pClient_Ext device, click button B3 to perform the connection.  

__You can interact with BLE p2pServer_Ext application with another Nucleo board running BLE p2pClient:__  

 - Power up BLE p2pClient device next to BLE p2pServer_Ext device.  
 - On BLE p2pClient device button B1 click, to start scanning.  
   - BLE p2pServer_Ext connectable legacy advertising in discovered, and the BD address is registered.  
   - Then, connection is performed.
