## <b>LPTIM_PulseCounter_Init Example Description</b>

How to use the LPTIM peripheral in counter mode to generate a PWM output signal 
and update its duty cycle. This example is based on the STM32WBAxx
LPTIM LL API. The peripheral is initialized with LL initialization 
function to demonstrate LL init usage.

To reduce power consumption, MCU enters stop mode after starting counting. Each
time the counter reaches the maximum value (Period/Autoreload), an interruption
is generated, the MCU is woken up from stop mode and LD1 toggles the last state.

In this example Period value is set to 1000, so each time the counter counts
(1000 + 1) rising edges on LPTIM1_IN1 pin, an interrupt is generated and LD1
toggles. If the external function generator is set to provide a square waveform at 1Khz,
the led will toggle each second.

In this example the internal clock provided to the LPTIM1 is LSI (32 kHz),
so the external input is sampled with LSI clock. In order not to miss any event,
the frequency of the changes on the external Input1 signal should never exceed the
frequency of the internal clock provided to the LPTIM1 (LSI for the
present example).

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

  - This example runs on STM32WBA52CGUx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-WBA52CG board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
    
  - Connect a square waveform generator to PA0 (Arduino connector CN7 pin 6 A5, Morpho connector CN3 pin 38).
    If the frequency of the signal is 1 kHz, LD1 toggles every second.
