## <b>TIM_PWMOutput_Init Example Description</b>

Use of a timer peripheral to generate a 
PWM output signal and update the PWM duty cycle. This example is based on the 
STM32WBAxx TIM LL API. The peripheral initialization uses 
LL initialization function to demonstrate LL Init.

In this example TIM3 input clock TIM3CLK is set to APB clock (PCLK),
since APB pre-scaler is equal to 1.
    TIM3CLK = PCLK
    PCLK = HCLK
    => TIM3CLK = HCLK = SystemCoreClock (100 MHz)

To set the TIM3 counter clock frequency to 10 KHz, the pre-scaler (PSC) is
calculated as follows:

	PSC = (TIM3CLK / TIM3 counter clock) - 1
	PSC = (SystemCoreClock /10 KHz) - 1

SystemCoreClock is set to 100 MHz for STM32WBAxx Devices.

Auto-reload (ARR) is calculated to get a time base period of 10 ms,
meaning a time base frequency of 100 Hz.

	ARR = (TIM3 counter clock / time base frequency) - 1
	ARR = (TIM3 counter clock / 100) - 1

Initially, the capture/compare register (CCR1) of the output channel is set to
half the auto-reload value meaning a initial duty cycle of 50%.
Generally speaking this duty cycle is calculated as follows:
D
	uty cycle = (CCR1 / ARR) * 100

The timer output channel must be connected to TIM3_CH1 on board NUCLEO-WBA52CG.
Thus TIM3_CH1 status (on/off) mirrors the timer output level (active v.s. inactive).

USER push-button can be used to change the duty cycle from 0% up to 100% by
steps of 10%. Duty cycle is periodically measured. It can be observed through
the debugger by watching the variable uwMeasuredDutyCycle.

Initially the output channel is configured in output compare toggle mode.
