## <b>PWR_EnterStandbyMode Example Description</b>

How to enter the Standby mode and wake up from this mode by using an external
reset or a wakeup pin.

In the associated software, the system clock is set to 100 MHz.
An EXTI line is connected to the USER push-button through PC.13 and configured to generate an
interrupt on Falling edge upon key press.

Request to enter in standby mode:
When a Falling edge is detected on the EXTI line, an interrupt is generated.
In the EXTI handler routine, the wake-up pin LL_PWR_WAKEUP_PIN2 is enabled and the
corresponding wake-up flag cleared. Then, the system enters Standby mode causing
LD1 to stop toggling.

Exit from Standby mode:
The user can wake-up the system in pressing the USER push-button which is
connected to the wake-up pin LL_PWR_WAKEUP_PIN2.
A Falling edge on WKUP pin will wake-up the system from Standby.

Alternatively, an external reset (reset button on board) will wake-up system from Standby
as well as wake-up pin.

After wake-up from Standby mode, program execution restarts in the same way as
after a reset and LD1 restarts toggling.
These steps are repeated in an infinite loop.

LD1 is used to monitor the system state as follows:

 - LD1 fast toggling (each 200ms): system in Run mode from reset (power on reset or reset pin while system was in Run mode)
 - LD1 slow toggling (each 500ms): system in Run mode after exiting from Standby mode
 - LD1 off: system in Standby mode

#### <b>Notes</b>

This example can not be used in DEBUG mode due to the fact
that the Cortex-M33 core is no longer clocked during low power mode
so debugging features are disabled.

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

  - This example runs on STM32WBA52CGUx devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-WBA52CG
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.

  - NUCLEO-WBA52CG Set-up
    - LD1 connected to PB.04 pin
    - User push-button connected to pin PC.13 (External line 13)
    - WakeUp Pin LL_PWR_WAKEUP_PIN2 connected to PC.13
