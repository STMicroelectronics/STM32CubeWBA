## <b>Application Licence Clarification</b>

The TFM application components are licensed by ST under Ultimate Liberty
license SLA0044. Read the file q_a.txt for Application Licence Clarification.

## <b>TFM Application Description</b>

The TFM provides a Root of Trust solution including Secure Boot and Secure
Firmware Update functionalities that is used before executing the application
and provides TFM secure services that are isolated from the non-secure
application but can be used by the non-secure application at run-time.

TFM application is based on the Open Source TF-M reference implementation
that has been ported on STM32 microcontroller to take benefit of STM32 HW
security features such as CM33 Trust Zone/MPU, Trust Zone aware peripherals,
Memory protections (HDP, WRP) and enhanced life cycle scheme.

The Secure Boot and Secure Firmware Update solution allows the update of the
STM32 microcontroller built-in program with new firmware versions, adding new
features and correcting potential issues. The update process is performed in
a secure way to prevent unauthorized updates and access to confidential
on-device data:

-   The Secure Boot (Root of Trust services) is an immutable code, always
    executed after a system reset, that checks STM32 static protections,
    activates STM32 runtime protections and then verifies the authenticity
    (RSA or ECDSA signature) and integrity (SHA256) of the application code
    before execution in order to ensure that invalid or malicious
    code cannot be run. The default asymmetric key (RSA or ECDSA) is taken from
    TFM_SBSFU_Boot\\Src\\keys.c
    and is embedded in the provisioned data area in the secure boot and secure
    firmware update binary.

-   The Secure Firmware Update application is an immutable code that detects
    that a new firmware image is available, and that checks its authenticity and
    integrity. It also decrypts it (AES-CTR) during installation, if image is
    installed in internal flash.
    The AES-CTR key is encrypted (RSA-OAEP or ECIES-P256) and provided in the
    firmware image itself. The default asymmetric key (RSA or ECDSA) used to
    encrypt the AES-CTR key is distinct from the signature key, but also taken
    from TFM_SBSFU_Boot\\Src\\keys.c.
    The firmware update can be done either on the secure part of firmware
    image and/or on the non-secure part of the firmware image.

The secure services are an updatable code implementing a set of services
managing critical assets that are isolated from the non-secure application
so that the non-secure application can't access directly to any of the critical
assets but can only use secure services that use the critical assets:

-   Crypto: secure cryptographic services based on opaque key APIs

-   Secure Storage: protect data Confidentiality/authenticity/Integrity

-   Internal Trusted Storage: protect data in internal flash

-   Attestation: prove product identity via Entity Attestation Token

### <b>How to use it ?</b>

Several steps to run TFM application :

<b>0. Prerequisite</b>

   Two versions of imgtool (used during build process) are available in mcuboot
   middleware: windows executable and python version. By default, the windows
   executable is selected. It is possible to switch to python version by:

   - installing python (Python 3.6 or newer) with the required modules from Middlewares\\Third_Party\\mcuboot\\scripts\\requirements.txt:

            pip install -r requirements.txt

   - having python in execution path variable
   - deleting imgtool.exe in Middlewares\\Third_Party\\mcuboot\\scripts\\dist\\imgtool

<b>1. Build</b>

   Build the TFM projects in the following order. This is mandatory as each
   projects requests some objects generated by the compilation of the previous
   one:
 
   1. Build TFM_SBSFU_Boot project.
      This step creates the secure boot and secure firmware update binary
      including provisionned user data (keys, IDs...).
      Depending on toolchain, it is located here:

            EWARM:        TFM_SBSFU_Boot\EWARM\NUCLEO-WBA52CG\Exe\Project.bin
            STM32CubeIDE: TFM_SBSFU_Boot\STM32CubeIDE\Release\TFM_SBSFU_Boot.bin

   2. Build TFM_Appli Secure project.
      This step creates the TFM Application Secure binary:

            EWARM:        TFM_Appli\EWARM\Secure\NUCLEO-WBA52CG_S\Exe\Project.bin
            STM32CubeIDE: TFM_Appli\STM32CubeIDE\Secure\Release\TFM_Appli_Secure.bin

      It also produces the clear TFM Secure app signed image for initial installation in:

           TFM_Appli\Binary\tfm_s_app_init.bin

      It also produces the encrypted TFM Secure app signed image for download in:

           TFM_Appli\Binary\tfm_s_app_enc_sign.bin

      It also produces the clear TFM Secure app signed image for download in:

           TFM_Appli\Binary\tfm_s_app_sign.bin

   3. Build TFM_Appli Non Secure project.
      This step creates the TFM Application Non Secure binary:
 
           EWARM:        TFM_Appli\EWARM\NonSecure\NUCLEO-WBA52CG_NS\Exe\Project.bin
           STM32CubeIDE: TFM_Appli\STM32CubeIDE\NonSecure\Release\TFM_Appli_NonSecure.bin

      It also produces the clear TFM Non Secure app signed image for initial installation in:

           TFM_Appli\Binary\tfm_ns_app_init.bin

      It also produces the encrypted TFM Non Secure app signed image for download in:

           TFM_Appli\Binary\tfm_ns_app_enc_sign.bin

      It also produces the clear TFM Non Secure app signed image for download in:

           TFM_Appli\Binary\tfm_ns_app_sign.bin

   4. Build TFM_Loader Secure project.
      This step creates the TFM loader Secure binary:

            EWARM:        TFM_Loader\EWARM\Secure\NUCLEO-WBA52CG_S\Exe\Project.bin
            STM32CubeIDE: TFM_Loader\STM32CubeIDE\Secure\Release\TFM_Loader_Secure.bin

   5. Build TFM_Loader Non Secure project.
      This step creates the TFM loader Non Secure binary:

            EWARM:        TFM_Loader\EWARM\NonSecure\NUCLEO-WBA52CG_NS\Exe\Project.bin
            STM32CubeIDE: TFM_Loader\STM32CubeIDE\NonSecure\Release\TFM_Loader_NonSecure.bin

      It also produced the assembled (S and NS) TFM loader image in:

            TFM_Loader\Binary\loader.bin

   6. Generate Secure and Non Secure Data images, by executing dataimg script:

            EWARM:        TFM_SBSFU_Boot\EWARM\dataimg.bat
            STM32CubeIDE: TFM_SBSFU_Boot\STM32CubeIDE\dataimg.sh

      It produces the clear TFM Secure and Non Secure data signed images for initial installation in:

           TFM_Appli\Binary\tfm_s_data_init.bin and TFM_Appli\Binary\tfm_ns_data_init.bin

      It produces the encrypted TFM Secure and Non Secure data signed images for download in:

           TFM_Appli\Binary\tfm_s_data_enc_sign.bin and TFM_Appli\Binary\tfm_ns_data_enc_sign.bin

      It produces the clear TFM Secure and Non Secure data signed images for download in:

           TFM_Appli\Binary\tfm_s_data_sign.bin and TFM_Appli\Binary\tfm_ns_data_sign.bin

      The TFM Secure data signed image contains initial attestation private key
      for TFM service. The TFM Non Secure data signed image contains dummy data
      for this example.

<b>2. Initialize the device</b>

   Depending on your toolchain, execute regression script (relying on
   STM32CubeProgrammer CLI tool) to easily perform device initialization in one
   shot:
```
    EWARM:        TFM_SBSFU_Boot\EWARM\regression.bat
    STM32CubeIDE: TFM_SBSFU_Boot\STM32CubeIDE\regression.sh
```

   As an alternative, it is also possible to initialize and verify manually the
   Option Bytes by means of STM32CubeProgrammer GUI tool:

   - Please ensure with STM32CubeProgammer the following Option bytes
     configuration for the device:
     - RDP         = 0xAA (RDP Level 0)
     - nSWBOOT0    = 1 (BOOT0 taken from BOOT0 pin)
     - TZEN        = 1 (TrustZone security enabled)
     - NSBOOTADD0  = 0x100000 (User flash address 0x08000000)
     - NSBOOTADD1  = 0x17F200 (System bootloader address 0x0BF90000)
     - SECBOOTADD0 = 0x1800c0 (boot entry point address 0xc006000)
     - SRAM2_RST   = 0 (SRAM2 erased at each reset)

   - Ensure also that these protections are all disabled in the Option Bytes
     configuration: BOOT_LOCK, HDP, WRP, SECWM.
 

   - Ensure also that device is mass erased.

   - Ensure also that OEM2LOCK bit in the FLASH_NSSR register is not set to be
   sure that any OEM2KEY was provisioned previously.
   If it is locked with another password, fill the regression script with this password.

   Additionally, the anti-tamper protection being enabled with active tamper pins usage by default,
   it is needed to connect TAMP_IN5 (PB7 on CN4 pin 33) and TAMP_OUT4 (PC13 on CN4 pin 36) on the NUCLEO-WBA52CG
   board, to allow the application to run. In case the tamper pins are opened or shorted, then the application is
   reset and blocked. It is however possible to disable the anti-tamper protection (refer to section 9).

<b>3. Use a terminal emulator</b>

   Serial port configuration should be :

   - Baud rate    = 115200
   - Data         = 8 bits
   - Parity       = none
   - Stop         = 1 bit
   - Flow control = none

   Terminal emulator is used for UART connection with the board.
   Connect terminal emulator to COM port of the board.
   The terminal emulator is used to log TFM information, and enter commands
   for User application.

<b>4. Program the TFM into flash</b>

   Program the TFM_SBSFU_Boot binary, the clear signed TFM_Appli Secure image for initial installation,
   the clear signed TFM_Appli Non Secure image for initial installation,
   and TFM_Loader image into internal flash.

   Program as well the TFM Secure and Non Secure data signed
   images for initial installation into internal flash.

   Depending on your toolchain, execute script TFM_UPDATE (relying on
   STM32CubeProgrammer CLI tool) to easily program the TFM into device internal
   flash in one shot:
```
    EWARM:        TFM_SBSFU_Boot\EWARM\TFM_UPDATE.bat
    STM32CubeIDE: TFM_SBSFU_Boot\STM32CubeIDE\TFM_UPDATE.sh
```

<b>5. Reset the board</b>

   Press the board reset button, and check the log information on the terminal emulator:

   - TFM_SBSFU_Boot application starts
   - Then it configures the static protections (because 'development mode' is used by default)
   - Then it get locked (because intrusion is detected)

<b>6. Unlock the board</b>

   To exit from locked state (intrusion), remove the jumper JP2 (IDD) on the board,
   then put it back in place. Check the log information:

   - TFM_SBSFU_Boot starts
   - Then it checks the static protections, and sets the dynamic protections
   - Then it initializes the BL2 NV area (BootLoader2 Non Volatile area)
   - Then it verifies the TFM application image signatures.
   - Then it jumps to the TFM application, displaying the User Application
       Main menu.

<b>7. Use User App</b>

   This user application gives access to a Main menu:
```
   1 - Test protections
   2 - Test TFM Secure services
   3 - New Fw Image
   4 - Non-Secure Data

   3. Press 3 to enter new firmware image menu

      This menu allows to manage new firmware images.

      It is possible to:
      - Download Secure App Image (#2): Download encrypted signed TFM_Appli Secure image
        (TFM_Appli\\Binary\\tfm_s_app_enc_sign.bin) or clear signed
        TFM_Appli Secure image (TFM_Appli\\Binary\\tfm_s_app_sign.bin)
      - Download NonSecure App Image (#3): Download encrypted signed TFM_Appli Non Secure image

      Send the signed binary with Tera Term by using menu:
      "File > Transfer > YMODEM > Send..."

      After the download, press (#1) or the reset button to reset the board.
      After reset, the downloaded firmware image is detected, verified,
      decrypted (if needed) and installed, then executed, by TFM_SBSFU_Boot.

   4. Press 4 to enter Non-Secure Data menu

      - Display Data from NS Data Image (#1)

Return to previous menu by pressing x.

<b>8. Use Local loader App</b>

   Local loader application is an immutable code, in non secure area.

   To enter local loader application, press user button during board reset.

   This application gives access to a menu which allows to download new firmware
   image.

   Refer to step "7. Use User App" for more information on the download image menu.

<b>9. Configuration</b>

   It is possible to change TFM configuration.
   When changing configuration, all the projects must be cleaned then fully rebuild.

   *  **Crypto-scheme**

      By default, the crypto scheme is RSA-2048 signature, and AES-CTR-128 image
      encryption with key RSA-OAEP encrypted.
      It is possible to select another crypto-scheme, with CRYPTO_SCHEME define in
      TFM_SBSFU_Boot\\Inc\\mcuboot_config\\mcuboot_config.h.

      ```
      #define CRYPTO_SCHEME_RSA2048    0x0 /* RSA-2048 signature, AES-CTR-128 encryption with key RSA-OAEP encrypted */
      #define CRYPTO_SCHEME_RSA3072    0x1 /* RSA-3072 signature, AES-CTR-128 encryption with key RSA-OAEP encrypted */
      #define CRYPTO_SCHEME_EC256      0x2 /* ECDSA-256 signature, AES-CTR-128 encryption with key ECIES-P256 encrypted */
      #define CRYPTO_SCHEME            CRYPTO_SCHEME_RSA2048  /* Select one of available crypto schemes */
      ```

   *  **HW accelerated cryptography**

      By default, the cryptography is accelerated with the HW crypto
      peripherals of the device (PKA, AES, HASH).
      It is possible to disable it in mcuboot by commenting BL2_HW_ACCEL_ENABLE
      define in TFM_SBSFU_Boot\\Inc\\config-boot.h.

      Similarly, it is possible to disable it in TFM crypto service by commenting
      TFM_HW_ACCEL_ENABLE define in TFM_Appli\\Secure\\Inc\\tfm_mbedcrypto_config.h.

   *  **Encryption**

      By default, the image encryption support is enabled.
      It is possible to disable the image encryption support with
      MCUBOOT_ENC_IMAGES define in TFM_SBSFU_Boot\\Inc\\mcuboot_config\\mcuboot_config.h.

      ```
      #define MCUBOOT_ENC_IMAGES           /* Defined: Image encryption enabled. */
      ```

   *  **Number of images**

      By default, 2 firmware app images are managed with 2 distincts signatures:
      1 image for NS app binary and 1 image for S app binary.
      It is possible to assemble NS and S app binaries into 1 image
      with 1 single signature, with MCUBOOT_APP_IMAGE_NUMBER define in
      Linker\\flash_layout.h.

      ```
      #define MCUBOOT_APP_IMAGE_NUMBER 1 /* 1: S and NS application binaries are assembled in one single image.
                                            2: Two separated images for S and NS application binaries. */
      ```

      By default, 1 firmware secure data image and 1 firmware non secure data image
      are managed with same signatures as respectively secure app image and non secure app image.
      It is possible to remove the data images, with MCUBOOT_S_DATA_IMAGE_NUMBER
      and MCUBOOT_NS_DATA_IMAGE_NUMBER defines in Linker\\flash_layout.h.

      ```
      #define MCUBOOT_S_DATA_IMAGE_NUMBER 1   /* 1: S data image for S application.
                                                 0: No S data image. */

      #define MCUBOOT_NS_DATA_IMAGE_NUMBER 1  /* 1: NS data image for NS application.
                                                 0: No NS data image. */
      ```

   *  **Number of slots per image**

      By default, primary and secondary slot configuration is used (for each image).
      In this mode, the local loader downloads encrypted image in secondary slot,
      and the TFM_SBSFU_Boot decrypts the image when installing it from
      secondary slot to primary slot.
      It is possible to configure the TFM_SBSFU_Boot to use primary slot only.
      In this mode, the local loader downloads encrypted image directly in
      primary slot, and the TFM_SBSFU_Boot decrypts in place the image during
      installation process.

      This is configured with MCUBOOT_PRIMARY_ONLY define in
      Linker\\flash_layout.h.

      ```
      #define MCUBOOT_PRIMARY_ONLY       /* Defined: No secondary (download) slot(s), only primary slot(s) for each image.
                                            Undefined: Primary and secondary slot(s) for each image. */
      ```

      Note: When primary and secondary slot configuration is selected, a
      menu item (#3) 'Download a new Fw Image' is present in user
      application. Its usage is exactly the same as the local loader application.
      When primary only slot configuration is selected, this menu item is not
      present in user application, it is not possible to download new Fw image
      from user application.

   *  **Image upgrade strategy**

      The bootloader supports either swap- or overwrite-based image upgrades,
      for primary and secondary slots configuration.
      In overwrite-based image upgrade mode, the image in secondary slot is
      overwriting image in primary slot.
      In swap-based image upgrade mode, images in primary and secondary slots
      are swapped. After swap, new image in primary slot has to be confirmed
      by user application, else at next boot the images will be swapped back.

      It is possible to select image upgrade strategy with
      MCUBOOT_OVERWRITE_ONLY define in Linker\\flash_layout.h.

      ```
      #define MCUBOOT_OVERWRITE_ONLY     /* Defined: the FW installation uses overwrite method.
                                            UnDefined: The FW installation uses swap mode. */
      ```

      Note: When overwrite method is selected, the User App menu 'New Fw Image'
      only allows to download image.
      When swap method is selected, this User App menu additionally allows to
      validate installed image, and to request re-installation of image that
      have been swapped back.

      Note: When image is swapped back into download area, image is re-encrypted
      (if initially encrypted).

   *  **Local loader**

      By default, local loader application is included. It is possible to remove
      it with MCUBOOT_EXT_LOADER define in Linker\\flash_layout.h.

      ```
      #define MCUBOOT_EXT_LOADER         /* Defined: Add external local loader application.
                                                     To enter it, press user button at reset.
                                            Undefined: No external local loader application. */
      ```

      In this case, the build of TFM_Loader must be skipped.

   *  **Application RoT**

      By default App RoT is enabled in TFM secure application. It is possible
      to disable it with TFM_PARTITION_APP_ROT define in Linker\\flash_layout.h.

      ```
      #define TFM_PARTITION_APP_ROT       /* comment to remove APP_ROT partition */
      ```

   *  **Anti-tamper**

      By default the anti-tamper is enabled for both internal and external tamper events. It is possible to change this configuration with TFM_TAMPER_ENABLE define in TFM_SBSFU_Boot\\Inc\\boot_hal_cfg.h.

      ```
      #define NO_TAMPER                     (0) /*!< No tamper activated */
      #define INTERNAL_TAMPER_ONLY          (1) /*!< Only Internal tamper activated */
      #define ALL_TAMPER                    (2) /*!< Internal and External tamper activated */

<b>10. Keys management</b>

   It is important to avoid using default keys provided in the example. A random keys generator is provided for each toolchain:
```
    EWARM:        TFM_SBSFU_Boot\EWARM\keygen.bat
    STM32CubeIDE: TFM_SBSFU_Boot\STM32CubeIDE\keygen.sh

```

<b>11. TrustZone deactivation</b>

   After having executed this application, the TZEN option bit is set.
   TZEN option bit must be reset to allow execution of any other non
   TrustZone application. To perform that, refer to AN5347.
