## <b>TFM_Loader Application description</b>

This project is used to generate the TFM loader image file.
The TFM_Loader application consists in two distinct projects: the TFM_Loader
Secure and Non Secure projects.
It has to be compiled after all TFM other ptojects.

In order to ease the development process, prebuild and postbuild commands are
integrated in each toolchain project.
The prebuild command is in charge of preparing the scatter file according to common
flash layout description in linker folder.
The postbuild command is in charge of preparing the loader image.
