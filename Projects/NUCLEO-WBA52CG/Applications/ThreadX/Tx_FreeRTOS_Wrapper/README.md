## <b>Tx_FreeRTOS_Wrapper Application Description</b>

This application provides an example of Azure RTOS ThreadX stack usage, it shows how to develop an application using the FreeRTOS adaptation layer for ThreadX.

The main entry function tx_application_define() is called by ThreadX during kernel start, at this stage, the application creates 1 thread :
'LED_Thread' (Priority : 5).

The 'LED_Thread' toggles the 'LED_GREEN' every 500ms.

#### <b>Expected success behavior</b>

'LED_GREEN' toggles every 500ms.

#### <b>Error behaviors</b>

'LED_RED' is turned on if any error occurs.

#### <b>Assumptions if any</b>
None

#### <b>Known limitations</b>
None

#### <b>ThreadX usage hints</b>

 - ThreadX uses the Systick as time base, thus it is mandatory that the HAL uses a separate time base through the TIM IPs.
 - ThreadX is configured with 100 ticks/sec by default, this should be taken into account when using delays or timeouts at application. It is always possible to reconfigure it in the "tx_user.h", the "TX_TIMER_TICKS_PER_SECOND" define,but this should be reflected in "tx_initialize_low_level.S" file too.
 - When using the FreeRTOS compatibility layer, make sure to match the "configTICK_RATE_HZ" value in "FreeRTOSConfig.h" to "TX_TIMER_TICKS_PER_SECOND".
 - ThreadX is disabling all interrupts during kernel start-up to avoid any unexpected behavior, therefore all system related calls (HAL, BSP) should be done either at the beginning of the application or inside the thread entry functions.
 - ThreadX offers the "tx_application_define()" function, that is automatically called by the tx_kernel_enter() API.
   It is highly recommended to use it to create all applications ThreadX related resources (threads, semaphores, memory pools...)  but it should not in any way contain a system API call (HAL or BSP).
 - Using dynamic memory allocation requires to apply some changes to the linker file.
   ThreadX needs to pass a pointer to the first free memory location in RAM to the tx_application_define() function,
   using the "first_unused_memory" argument.
   This require changes in the linker files to expose this memory location.
    + For EWARM add the following section into the .icf file:
     ```
	 place in RAM_region    { last section FREE_MEM };
	 ```
    + For MDK-ARM:
	```
    either define the RW_IRAM1 region in the ".sct" file
    or modify the line below in "tx_initialize_low_level.S to match the memory region being used
        LDR r1, =|Image$$RW_IRAM1$$ZI$$Limit|
	```
    + For STM32CubeIDE add the following section into the .ld file:
	```
    ._threadx_heap :
      {
         . = ALIGN(8);
         __RAM_segment_used_end__ = .;
         . = . + 64K;
         . = ALIGN(8);
       } >RAM_D1 AT> RAM_D1
	```

       The simplest way to provide memory for ThreadX is to define a new section, see ._threadx_heap above.
       In the example above the ThreadX heap size is set to 64KBytes.
       The ._threadx_heap must be located between the .bss and the ._user_heap_stack sections in the linker script.
       Caution: Make sure that ThreadX does not need more than the provided heap memory (64KBytes in this example).
       Read more in STM32CubeIDE User Guide, chapter: "Linker script".

    + The "tx_initialize_low_level.S" should be also modified to enable the "USE_DYNAMIC_MEMORY_ALLOCATION" flag.
