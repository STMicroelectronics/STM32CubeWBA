## <b>SBSFU Application Description</b>

The SBSFU provides a Root of Trust solution including Secure Boot and Secure Firmware Update functionalities that is used before
executing the application and provides an example of secure service (GPIO toggle) that is isolated from the non-secure application
but can be used by the non-secure application at run-time.

SBSFU application is based on the Open Source TF-M reference implementation that has been ported on STM32 microcontroller to take
benefit of STM32 HW security features such as CM33 Trust Zone/MPU, Trust Zone aware peripherals, Memory protections (HDP, WRP) and
enhanced life cycle scheme.

The Secure Boot and Secure Firmware Update solution allows the update of the STM32 microcontroller built-in program with new firmware
 versions, adding new features and correcting potential issues. The update process is performed in  a secure way to prevent unauthorized
 updates and access to confidential on-device data:

-   The Secure Boot (Root of Trust services) is an immutable code, always executed after a system reset, that checks STM32 static protections,
activates STM32 runtime protections and then verifies the authenticity (RSA or ECDSA signature) and integrity (SHA256) of the application code
before execution in order to ensure that invalid or malicious code cannot be run. The default asymmetric key (RSA or ECDSA) is taken from
 SBSFU_Boot\\Src\\keys.c and is embedded in the provisioned data area in the secure boot and secure firmware update binary.

-   The Secure Firmware Update application is an immutable code that detects that a new firmware image is available, and that checks its
authenticity and integrity. It also decrypts it (AES-CTR) during installation, if image is installed in internal flash. The AES-CTR key
is encrypted (RSA-OAEP or ECIES-P256) and provided in the firmware image itself. The default asymmetric key (RSA or ECDSA) used to encrypt
the AES-CTR key is distinct from the signature key, but also taken from SBSFU_Boot\\Src\\keys.c. The firmware update can be done either on
the secure part of firmware image and/or on the non-secure part of the firmware image.

The SBSFU Secure application configures 2 IOs in secure mode:

- The secure IO PB.04 (corresponding to LD1) toggles every second on Secure SysTick timer interrupt basis.

- The secure IO PB.11 (corresponding to LD2) toggles when secure service is triggered by the user application.

For more details, refer to AN5447 "Overview of Secure Boot and Secure Firmware Update solution on Arm&#174; TrustZone&#174; STM32
microcontrollers" available from the STMicroelectronics microcontroller website www.st.com.

## <b>How to use it ?</b>

Several steps to run SBSFU application :

<b>0. Prerequisite</b>

   Two versions of imgtool (used during build process) are available in mcuboot middleware: windows executable and python version. By default,
the windows executable is selected. It is possible to switch to python version by:

   - installing python (Python 3.6 or newer) with the required modules from Middlewares\\Third_Party\\mcuboot\\scripts\\requirements.txt:

            pip install -r requirements.txt

   - having python in execution path variable
   - deleting imgtool.exe in Middlewares\\Third_Party\\mcuboot\\scripts\\dist\\imgtool

<b>1. Build</b>

   Build the SBSFU projects in the following order. This is mandatory as each projects requests some objects generated by the compilation
of the previous one:

   1. Build SBSFU_Boot project.
      This step creates the secure boot and secure firmware update binary including provisionned user data (keys, IDs...). Depending on
toolchain, it is located here:

            EWARM:        SBSFU_Boot\EWARM\NUCLEO-WBA52CG\Exe\Project.bin
            STM32CubeIDE: SBSFU_Boot\STM32CubeIDE\Release\SBSFU_Boot.bin

   2. Build SBSFU_Appli Secure project.
      This step creates the SBSFU Application Secure binary:

            EWARM:        SBSFU_Appli\EWARM\Secure\NUCLEO-WBA52CG_S\Exe\Project.bin
            STM32CubeIDE: SBSFU_Appli\STM32CubeIDE\Secure\Release\SBSFU_Appli_Secure.bin

   3. Build SBSFU_Appli Non Secure project.
      This step creates the SBSFU Application Non Secure binary:

            EWARM:        SBSFU_Appli\EWARM\NonSecure\NUCLEO-WBA52CG_NS\Exe\Project.bin
            STM32CubeIDE: SBSFU_Appli\STM32CubeIDE\NonSecure\Release\SBSFU_Appli_NonSecure.bin

      It also produces the assembled (S and NS) SBSFU Application binary in:

            SBSFU_Appli\Binary\sbsfu_app.bin

      It also produces the clear assembled SBSFU app signed image for initial installation in:

            SBSFU_Appli\Binary\sbsfu_app_init.bin

      It also produces the encrypted assembled SBSFU app signed image for download in:

            SBSFU_Appli\Binary\sbsfu_app_enc_sign.bin

      It also produces the clear assembled SBSFU app signed image for download in:

            SBSFU_Appli\Binary\sbsfu_app_sign.bin

   4. Build SBSFU_Loader Secure project.
      This step creates the SBSFU loader Secure binary:

            EWARM:        SBSFU_Loader\EWARM\Secure\NUCLEO-WBA52CG_S\Exe\Project.bin
            STM32CubeIDE: SBSFU_Loader\STM32CubeIDE\Secure\Release\SBSFU_Loader_Secure.bin

   5. Build SBSFU_Loader Non Secure project.
      This step creates the SBSFU loader Non Secure binary:

            EWARM:        SBSFU_Loader\EWARM\NonSecure\NUCLEO-WBA52CG_NS\Exe\Project.bin
            STM32CubeIDE: SBSFU_Loader\STM32CubeIDE\NonSecure\Release\SBSFU_Loader_NonSecure.bin

      It also produced the assembled (S and NS) SBSFU loader image in:

            SBSFU_Loader\Binary\loader.bin

   6. Generate Secure and Non Secure Data images, by executing dataimg script:

            EWARM:        SBSFU_Boot\EWARM\dataimg.bat
            STM32CubeIDE: SBSFU_Boot\STM32CubeIDE\dataimg.sh

      It produces the clear SBSFU Secure and Non Secure data signed images for initial installation in:

            SBSFU_Appli\Binary\sbsfu_s_data_init.bin and SBSFU_Appli\Binary\sbsfu_ns_data_init.bin

      It produces the encrypted SBSFU Secure and Non Secure data signed images for download in:

            SBSFU_Appli\Binary\sbsfu_s_data_enc_sign.bin and SBSFU_Appli\Binary\sbsfu_ns_data_enc_sign.bin

      It produces the clear SBSFU Secure and Non Secure data signed images for download in:

            SBSFU_Appli\Binary\sbsfu_s_data_sign.bin and SBSFU_Appli\Binary\sbsfu_ns_data_sign.bin

      The SBSFU Secure and Non Secure data signed images contains dummy data for this example.

<b>2. Initialize the device</b>

   Depending on your toolchain, execute regression script (relying on STM32CubeProgrammer CLI tool) to easily perform device initialization
in one shot:
```
    EWARM:        SBSFU_Boot\EWARM\regression.bat
    STM32CubeIDE: SBSFU_Boot\STM32CubeIDE\regression.sh
```

   As an alternative, it is also possible to initialize and verify manually the Option Bytes by means of STM32CubeProgrammer GUI tool:

   - Please ensure with STM32CubeProgammer the following Option bytes configuration for the device:
     - RDP         = 0xAA (RDP Level 0)
     - nSWBOOT0    = 1 (BOOT0 taken from BOOT0 pin)
     - TZEN        = 1 (TrustZone security enabled)
     - NSBOOTADD0  = 0x100000 (User flash address 0x08000000)
     - NSBOOTADD1  = 0x17F200 (System bootloader address 0x0BF90000)
     - SECBOOTADD0 = 0x1800c0 (boot entry point address 0xc006000)
     - SRAM2_RST   = 0 (SRAM2 erased at each reset)
   - Ensure also that these protections are all disabled in the Option Bytes
     configuration: BOOT_LOCK, HDP, WRP, SECWM.
   - Ensure also that device is mass erased.
   - Ensure also that OEM2LOCK bit in the FLASH_NSSR register is not set to be
   sure that any OEM2KEY was provisioned previously.
   If it is locked with another password, fill the regression script with this password.

   Additionally, the anti-tamper protection being enabled with active tamper pins usage by default,
   it is needed to connect TAMP_IN5 (PB7 on CN4 pin 33) and TAMP_OUT4 (PC13 on CN4 pin 36) on the NUCLEO-WBA52CG
   board, to allow the application to run. In case the tamper pins are opened or shorted, then the application is
   reset and blocked. It is however possible to disable the anti-tamper protection (refer to section 9)

<b>3. Use a terminal emulator</b>

   Serial port configuration should be :

   - Baud rate    = 115200
   - Data         = 8 bits
   - Parity       = none
   - Stop         = 1 bit
   - Flow control = none

Terminal emulator is used for UART connection with the board.
Connect terminal emulator to COM port of the board.
The terminal emulator is used to log SBSFU information, and enter commands for User application.

<b>4. Program the SBSFU into flash</b>

   Program the SBSFU_Boot binary, the clear signed SBSFU_Appli image for initial installation, and SBSFU_Loader image into internal flash.

   Depending on your toolchain, execute script SBSFU_UPDATE (relying on STM32CubeProgrammer CLI tool) to easily program the SBSFU into device
internal flash in one shot:
```
    EWARM:        SBSFU_Boot\EWARM\SBSFU_UPDATE.bat
    STM32CubeIDE: SBSFU_Boot\STM32CubeIDE\SBSFU_UPDATE.sh
```

<b>5. Reset the board</b>

   Press the board reset button, and check the log information on the terminal emulator:

   - SBSFU_Boot application starts
   - Then it configures the static protections (because 'development mode' is used by default)
   - Then it get locked (because intrusion is detected)

<b>6. Unlock the board</b>

   To exit from locked state (intrusion), remove the jumper JP2 (IDD) on the board, then put it back in place. Check the log information:

   - SBSFU_Boot starts
   - Then it checks the static protections, and sets the dynamic protections
   - Then it verifies the SBSFU application image signatures.
   - Then it jumps to the SBSFU application, displaying the User Application Main menu.

<b>7. Use User App</b>

   This user application gives access to a Main menu:
```
   1 - Test protections
   2 - Test Secure LED
```

   1. Press 1 to enter test protections menu

      - Test Protection (#1): test unauthorized accesses to Secure side from Non Secure side, and to Secure Privileged side from Secure Non
Privileged side. Several successive unauthorized accesses to different areas are performed, leading to successive reset when fault occurs.

      Return to previous menu by pressing x.

   2. Press 2 to toggle Secure LED (LD2)

   3. Press 4 to enter Non-Secure Data menu
      - Display Data from NS Data Image (#1)

	  Return to previous menu by pressing x.

<b>8. Use Local loader App</b>

   Local loader application is an immutable code, in non secure and secure areas.

   To enter local loader application, press user button during board reset.

   This application gives access to a menu which allows to download new firmware image.

   It is possible to:

   - Download App Image (#2): Download encrypted signed SBSFU_Appli image (SBSFU_Appli\\Binary\\sbsfu_app_enc_sign.bin) or clear signed
SBSFU_Appli image (SBSFU_Appli\\Binary\\sbsfu_app_sign.bin)

   Send the signed binary with Tera Term by using menu: "File > Transfer > YMODEM > Send..."

   After the download, press (#1) to reset the board, or press the reset button. After reset, the downloaded firmware image is detected,
verified, decrypted (if needed) and installed, then executed, by SBSFU_Boot.

<b>9. Configuration</b>

   It is possible to change SBSFU configuration. When changing configuration, all the projects must be cleaned then fully rebuild.

   *  **Crypto-scheme**

      By default, the crypto scheme is RSA-2048 signature, and AES-CTR-128 image encryption with key RSA-OAEP encrypted. It is possible
to select another crypto-scheme, with CRYPTO_SCHEME define in SBSFU_Boot\\Inc\\mcuboot_config\\mcuboot_config.h.

      ```
      #define CRYPTO_SCHEME_RSA2048    0x0 /* RSA-2048 signature, AES-CTR-128 encryption with key RSA-OAEP encrypted */
      #define CRYPTO_SCHEME_RSA3072    0x1 /* RSA-3072 signature, AES-CTR-128 encryption with key RSA-OAEP encrypted */
      #define CRYPTO_SCHEME_EC256      0x2 /* ECDSA-256 signature, AES-CTR-128 encryption with key ECIES-P256 encrypted */
      #define CRYPTO_SCHEME            CRYPTO_SCHEME_RSA2048  /* Select one of available crypto schemes */
      ```

   *  **HW accelerated cryptography**

      By default, the cryptography is accelerated with the HW crypto peripherals of the device (PKA, AES, HASH). It is possible to disable
it in mcuboot by commenting BL2_HW_ACCEL_ENABLE define in SBSFU_Boot\\Inc\\config-boot.h.

   *  **Encryption**

      By default, the image encryption support is enabled. It is possible to disable the image encryption support with MCUBOOT_ENC_IMAGES
define in SBSFU_Boot\\Inc\\mcuboot_config\\mcuboot_config.h.

      ```
      #define MCUBOOT_ENC_IMAGES           /* Defined: Image encryption enabled. */
      ```

   *  **Number of images**

      By default, 1 firmware app image is managed with 1 single signature: 1 image for both NS and S app binaries. It is possible to separate
NS and S app binaries into 2 images with 2 distinct signatures, with MCUBOOT_APP_IMAGE_NUMBER define in Linker\\flash_layout.h.

      ```
      #define MCUBOOT_APP_IMAGE_NUMBER 1 /* 1: S and NS application binaries are assembled in one single image.
                                            2: Two separated images for S and NS application binaries. */
      ```

      By default, no data image is managed. It is possible to add 1 firmware secure data image and 1 firmware non secure data image, with
MCUBOOT_S_DATA_IMAGE_NUMBER and MCUBOOT_NS_DATA_IMAGE_NUMBER defines in Linker\\flash_layout.h.

      ```
      #define MCUBOOT_S_DATA_IMAGE_NUMBER 1   /* 1: S data image for S application.
                                                 0: No S data image. */

      #define MCUBOOT_NS_DATA_IMAGE_NUMBER 1  /* 1: NS data image for NS application.
                                                 0: No NS data image. */
      ```

   *  **Number of slots per image**

      By default, primary slot only configuration is used (for each image). In this mode, the local loader downloads encrypted image directly
in primary slot, and the SBSFU_Boot decrypts in place the image during installation process. It is possible to configure the SBSFU_Boot to use a secondary slot for image downloading. The SBSFU_Boot decrypts the image when installing it from secondary slot to primary slot.

	  This is configured with MCUBOOT_PRIMARY_ONLY define in Linker\\flash_layout.h.
      ```
      #define MCUBOOT_PRIMARY_ONLY       /* Defined: No secondary (download) slot(s), only primary slot(s) for each image.
                                            Undefined: Primary and secondary slot(s) for each image. */
      ```

      Note: When primary and secondary slot configuration is selected, a menu item (#3) 'Download a new Fw Image' is present in user
application. Its usage is exactly the same as the local loader application. When primary only slot configuration is selected, this menu
item is not present in user application, it is not possible to download new Fw image   from user application.

   *  **Image upgrade strategy**

      The bootloader supports either swap- or overwrite-based image upgrades, for primary and secondary slots configuration. In overwrite-based
image upgrade mode, the image in secondary slot is overwriting image in primary slot. In swap-based image upgrade mode, images in primary and
secondary slots are swapped. After swap, new image in primary slot has to be confirmed by user application, else at next boot the images will
be swapped back.

	  It is possible to select image upgrade strategy with MCUBOOT_OVERWRITE_ONLY define in Linker\\flash_layout.h.

      ```
      #define MCUBOOT_OVERWRITE_ONLY     /* Defined: the FW installation uses overwrite method.
                                            UnDefined: The FW installation uses swap mode. */
      ```

      Note: When overwrite method is selected, the User App menu 'New Fw Image' only allows to download image. When swap method is selected,
this User App menu additionally allows to validate installed image, and to request re-installation of image that have been swapped back.

      Note: When image is swapped back into download area, image is re-encrypted (if initially encrypted).

   *  **Local loader**

      By default, local loader application is included. It is possible to remove it with MCUBOOT_EXT_LOADER define in Linker\\flash_layout.h.

      ```
      #define MCUBOOT_EXT_LOADER         /* Defined: Add external local loader application. To enter it, press user button at reset.
                                            Undefined: No external local loader application. */
      ```

      In this case, the build of SBSFU_Loader must be skipped.

   *  **Anti-tamper**

      By default the anti-tamper is enabled for both internal and external tamper events. It is possible to change this configuration with
TFM_TAMPER_ENABLE define in SBSFU_Boot\\Inc\\boot_hal_cfg.h.

      ```
      #define NO_TAMPER            (0)                /*!< No tamper activated */
      #define INTERNAL_TAMPER_ONLY (1)                /*!< Only Internal tamper activated */
      #define ALL_TAMPER           (2)                /*!< Internal and External tamper activated */
      #define TFM_TAMPER_ENABLE ALL_TAMPER            /*!< TAMPER configuration flag  */
      ```

<b>10. Keys management</b>

   It is important to avoid using default keys provided in the example. A random keys generator is provided for each toolchain:
```
      EWARM:        SBSFU_Boot\EWARM\keygen.bat
      STM32CubeIDE: SBSFU_Boot\STM32CubeIDE\keygen.sh
```

<b>11. TrustZone deactivation</b>

   After having executed this application, the TZEN option bit is set. TZEN option bit must be reset to allow execution of any other non
TrustZone application. To perform that, refer to AN5347.
