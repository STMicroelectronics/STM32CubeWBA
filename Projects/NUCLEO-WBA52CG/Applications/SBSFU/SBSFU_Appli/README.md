## <b>SBSFU_Appli Application description</b>

The SBSFU_Appli application consists in two distinct projects: the SBSFU_Appli
Secure and SBSFU_Appli Non Secure projects.

The SBSFU_Appli Secure project is used to generate the SBSFU_Appli Secure binary file.
It has to be compiled after TFM_SBSFU_Boot project.

The SBSFU_Appli Non Secure project is used to generate the SBSFU_Appli Non Secure binary file.
It has to be compiled after SBSFU_Appli Secure project.

In order to ease the development process, prebuild and postbuild commands are
integrated in each toolchain for both projects.
The prebuild command is in charge of preparing the scatter file according to
common flash layout description in linker folder.
The postbuild command is in charge of signing the binaries, so that they are
trusted by firmware update process.
