## <b>GPIO_IOToggle Example Description</b>

How to configure and use GPIOs through the HAL API.

PA.00 IO (configured in output pushpull mode) toggles in a forever loop.
On STM32WBA55G-DK1 board this IO is connected to LD3.

In this example, HCLK is configured at 100 MHz.

#### <b>Notes</b>

 1. Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
    based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
    a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
    than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
    To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

 2. The example needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
    to have correct HAL operation.
