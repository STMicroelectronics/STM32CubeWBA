### __How to use it?__

In order to make the program work:  

 - Open your preferred toolchain.  
 - Rebuild all files and flash the board at the address 0x08000000 with the binary file.  

Use one of the following remote interfaces to interact with your device <a href="https://wiki.st.com/stm32mcu/wiki/Connectivity:BLE_smartphone_applications#Bluetooth-C2-AE_LE_collector_applications_for_STM32WBA
"> Bluetooth LE collector applications for STM32WBA.</a>  

Reset the B-WBA5M-WPAN Nucleo board and launch remote interface on PC/android/ios device.  

 - Click on WBA5M_xx to connect the board.  
 - Select Environmental Data to display temperature and humidity.  
 - Display Plot Data and play the accelerometer data (moving the board will modify the displayed values).
