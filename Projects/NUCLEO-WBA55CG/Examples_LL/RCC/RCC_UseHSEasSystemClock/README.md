## <b>RCC_UseHSEasSystemClock Example Description</b>

Use of the RCC LL API to start the HSE and use it as system clock.

At start-up, HSI clock is used as system clock (default clock after reset) and then Systick is 
configured at 1 ms using HSI_VALUE define.

Then, HSE is started and we wait for ready state. System clock is set to HSE thanks to IT 
triggered by HSE ready.

- LD1 is turned ON to indicate that HSE is ready.
- LD1 is toggled with a timing of 1 second in case of error to switch SYSCLK to HSE or if HSE CSS
failure is detected (through NMI IT).
