## <b>PKA_ECDSA_Verify Example Description</b>

How to determine if a given signature is valid regarding the Elliptic curve digital signature algorithm
(ECDSA).

For this example, a test vector have been extracted from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)

 - Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP) in order to demonstrate the usage of the hal.
This reference files can be found under:

"http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/documents/dss/186-3ecdsatestvectors.zip (ZIP SigGen.rsp)"

This test vector has been chosen to demonstrate the behavior in a case where the input signature
is valid. A second input is provided where one element of the hash message has been modified to 
demonstrate the behavior in a case where the signature is invalid. Their definitions are included 
in SigVer.c. You can refer to this file for more information.

The selected curve for this example is P-256 (ECDSA-256) published by NIST in 
Federal Information Processing Standards Publication FIPS PUB 186-4. The description
of this curve is present in file Src/prime256v1.c.

In case of success, the LD1 (BLUE) is ON.

In case of any error, the LD1 (BLUE) is toggling slowly.

#### <b>Notes</b>

1. Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
   based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
   a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
   than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
   To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
2. The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
   to have correct HAL operation.
