## <b>RTC_Tamper Example Description</b>

Configuration of the tamper detection with backup registers erase.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
clock (SYSCLK) to run at 100 MHz.

The RTC peripheral configuration is ensured by the MX_RTC_Init() and MX_TAMP_RTC_Init functions.
HAL_RTC_MspInit()function which core is implementing the configuration of the needed RTC resources
according to the used hardware (CLOCK,PWR, RTC clock source and BackUp). 
You may update this function to change RTC configuration.

**Note:** LSE oscillator clock is used as RTC clock source (32.768 kHz) by default.

This example performs the following:

1. Please, run the software.
2. It configures the Tamper 4 pin  and enables the Tamper 4 interrupt.
3. It writes a data to a RTC Backup register, then check if the data is correctly written.
4. USER Button is linked To Tamper 4 pin (PC13). Please press it to generate a tamper detection.
5. The RTC backup register is reset and the Tamper interrupt is generated.
   The firmware then checks if the RTC Backup register is cleared.
6. LD1 turns ON, Test is OK.
   LD1 blinks, Test is KO.

#### <b>Notes</b>

 1. Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
    based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
    a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
    than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
    To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

 2. The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
    to have correct HAL operation.
