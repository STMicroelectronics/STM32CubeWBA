## <b>CORTEXM_MPU example Description</b>

Presentation of the MPU features. This example configures MPU attributes of different
MPU regions then configures a memory area as privileged read-only, and attempts to
perform read and write operations in different modes.

If the access is permitted LD1 is toggling. If the access is not permitted, 
a memory management fault is generated and LD3 is ON.

To generate an MPU memory fault exception due to an access right error, uncomment
the following line "PrivilegedReadOnlyArray[0] = 'e';" in the "stm32_mpu.c" file.

### <b>Notes</b>

 1. Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
    based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
    a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
    than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
    To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

 2. The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
    to have correct HAL operation.
