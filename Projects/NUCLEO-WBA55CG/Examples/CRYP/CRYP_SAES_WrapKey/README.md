## <b>CRYP_SAES_WrapKey Example Description</b>
  
How to use the Secure AES co-processor (SAES) peripheral to wrap application keys
using hardware secret key DHUK then use it to encrypt in polling mode.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32WBA55CGUx Devices :
The CPU at 100 MHz.

The Secure AES instance is configured in wrap mode and hardware secret key DHUK is selected.
The goal here to not share application key with users.
First, application key is encrypted (the result is stored in Encryptedkey buffer).
Then, user decrypt Encryptedkey, now application key is loaded in SAES_KEYRx registers
(without knowing him), immediately usable by users for any SAES operation.
Finally, ECB encryption/decryption is performed using key already in SAES_KEYRx registers
and results are compared with expected ones.

The Secure AES mode requires:

1. Application keys (AESKey256) to be wrapped using DHUK(derived hardware unique key).
2. Plain text (Plaintext) which will be encrypted.
3. Cipher text (CiphertextAESECB256)  which is the encryption result of the Plaint text.

In this example, LD1 (led BLUE) is turned on when the operation finish with success. 
and LD3 (led RED) is turned on when the operation generate an error.

#### <b>Notes</b>

1. Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
   based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
   a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
   than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
   To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

2. The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
   to have correct HAL operation.
