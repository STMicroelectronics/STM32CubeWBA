## <b>RSA_PKCS1v2.2_EncryptDecryptCRT_MBED Application Description</b>

This application describes how to use the PSA Ref API to encrypt and decrypt
a message using the RSA PKCS#1 v2.2 compliant algorithm.

This application is configured to use the MBED library.

This application demonstrates how to use the library services to perform RSA operation
in a single call method: the configuration of the algorithm, and the operation
is done in one single API call.

This application is scheduled as follow:

  - The encryption of a known message
  - The decryption of the previously computed ciphertext using the chinese remainder theorem
    (CRT) representation, so that generated plaintext can be compared with the know message

####  <b>Expected success behavior</b>

- The green led will be turned on
- The global variable glob_status will be set to PASSED

#### <b>Error behaviors</b>

- The green led will be toggled each 250 milliseconds in an infinity loop.
- The global variable glob_status will be set to FAILED
