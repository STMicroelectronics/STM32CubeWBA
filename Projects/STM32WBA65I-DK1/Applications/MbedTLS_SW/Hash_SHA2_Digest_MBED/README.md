## <b>Hash_SHA2_Digest_MBED Application Description</b>

This application describes how to use the PSA Ref API to digest a message
using the SHA256 algorithm.

This application is configured to use the Hardware library.

This application demonstrates two way of using the API:

  - The single call method: the configuration of the algorithm, and the operation is done
in one single API call
  - The multiple calls method: the configuration of the algorithm, and the operation is done
in several API calls, allowing in particular a piecemeal injection of data to process.

Each way is composed of:

  - A hashing of a known message, followed by the verification of the generated digest

####  <b>Expected success behavior</b>

- The green led will be turned on
- The global variable glob_status will be set to PASSED

#### <b>Error behaviors</b>

- The green led will be toggled each 250 milliseconds in an infinity loop.
- The global variable glob_status will be set to FAILED
