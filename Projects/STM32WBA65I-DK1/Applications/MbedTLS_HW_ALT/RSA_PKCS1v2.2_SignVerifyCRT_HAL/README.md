## <b>RSA_PKCS1v2.2_SignVerifyCRT_HAL Application Description</b>

This application describes how to use the PSA Ref API to sign and verify
a message using the RSA PKCS#1 v2.2 compliant algorithm.

This application is configured to use the STCryptoLib Hardware library.

This application demonstrates how to use the library services to perform RSA operation
in a single call method: the configuration of the algorithm, and the operation
is done in one single API call.

This application is scheduled as follow:

  - The signature of the message using the chinese remainder theorem (CRT) representation
  - The verification of the message with the previously computed signature
    It's no longer necessary to carry out a preliminary step to calculate the hash of the
    message to be signed, the PSA interface includes this functionality.

####  <b>Expected success behavior</b>

- The green led will be turned on
- The global variable glob_status will be set to PASSED

#### <b>Error behaviors</b>

- The green led will be toggled each 250 milliseconds in an infinity loop.
- The global variable glob_status will be set to FAILED
