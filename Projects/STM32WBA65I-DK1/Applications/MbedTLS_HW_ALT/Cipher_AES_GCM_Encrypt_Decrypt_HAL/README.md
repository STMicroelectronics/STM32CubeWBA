## <b>Cipher_AES_GCM_Encrypt_Decrypt_HAL Application Description</b>

This application describes how to use the PSA Ref API to perform
authenticated encryption and verified decryption using the AES GCM algorithm.

This application is configured to use the HW library.

This application demonstrates two way of using the API:

  - The single call method: the configuration of the algorithm, and the operation is done
in one single API call
  - The multiple calls method: the configuration of the algorithm, and the operation is done
in several API calls, allowing in particular a piecemeal injection of data to process.
This mode is currently not supported by the PSA API.

Each way is composed of:

  - An authenticated encryption of a known plaintext, followed by the verification of the generated ciphertext
  - An verified decryption of a known ciphertext, followed by the verification of the generated plaintext

####  <b>Expected success behavior</b>

- The green led will be turned on
- The global variable glob_status will be set to PASSED

#### <b>Error behaviors</b>

- The green led will be toggled each 250 milliseconds in an infinity loop.
- The global variable glob_status will be set to FAILED
